			"description": "<div>Data describes vegetation extent priorities for each stream reach across the Melbourne Water region. Each reach is classified as either high, medium or low priority. To meet the performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018), high priority reaches need to be revegetated by 2028. To meet the target trajectory scores of the Healthy Waterways Strategy, medium priority reaches need to be revegetated by 2068. Vegetation priority reaches were determined by a combination of decision support tools and the co-design process. The decision support tool used was Zonation, which prioritised management actions across the region with the objective of improving instream habitat suitability for platypus, fish and macroinvertebrates.</div><div><br /></div><div>For the most up-to-date performance objectives, see the co-designed Catchment Programs at: <a href='https://www.melbournewater.com.au/about-us/strategies-achievements-and-policies/healthy-waterways-strategy' rel='nofollow ugc'>https://www.melbournewater.com.au/about-us/strategies-achievements-and-policies/healthy-waterways-strategy</a> </div><div><br /></div><div>Results are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning).

The data was developed by the University of Melbourne through the Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership as part of the development of Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Analysis has been undertaken across the Melbourne Water operating region, where the operating region has been divided into 16,346 sub-catchments. Of these 16,346 subcatchments, 8233 contain Melbourne Water waterways. The results are presented for each of these 8233 reaches. The data was used to estimate scores for platypus presented in the HWS for three scenarios:</div><div><ul><li>Current: habitat suitability for platypus under current conditions (i.e. 2014).</li><li>Current trajectory: habitat suitability for platypus under urbanisation and climate change scenarios if current management approaches continue.</li><li>Target trajectory: habitat suitability for platypus given urbanisation and climate change (as for current trajectory), together with (a) delivery of performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy and (b) achievement of environmental condition scores as described in the Catchment Programs of the Healthy Waterways Strategy. Presentation of habitat suitabilty model results for platypus from the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. </li></ul></div><div><br /></div><div>Habitat Suitability Model results have been thoroughly reviewed and are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning).

			"description": "<div>Data describes habitat suitability modelling (HSM) results for macroinvertebrates in streams. The data was developed by University of Melbourne through the Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership as part of the development of Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Analysis has been undertaken across the Melbourne Water operating region, where the operating region has been divided into 16,346 sub-catchments. Of these 16,346 subcatchments, 8233 contain Melbourne Water waterways. The results are presented for each of these 8233 reaches. The data was used to estimate the scores for macroninvertebrates presented in the HWS for three scenarios:</div><div><ul><li>Current: habitat suitability under current conditions (i.e. 2014).</li><li>Current trajectory: habitat suitability under urbanisation and climate change scenarios if current management approaches continue.</li><li>Target trajectory: habitat suitability given urbanisation and climate change (as for current trajectory), together with (a) delivery of performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy and (b) achievement of environmental condition scores as described in the Catchment Programs of the Healthy Waterways Strategy.</li></ul></div><div>Data has also been captured for a range of modelled HSM scenarios involving revegetation, stormwater management and climate change. Primary purpose is for waterways planning and analysis.</div><div><br /></div><div>Habitat Suitability Model results have been thoroughly reviewed and are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning). This data set covers the entire Melbourne Water region with the exception of very small areas close to Port Phillip Bay or Western Port. For example, there are small areas of French Island which are not captured.</div><div><br /></div><div>This data set was created using: 1. Streams dataset for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018.

This includes 5 catchments, and 69 sub-catchments. The boundaries of each region generally follow catchment boundaries. There are two separate spatial scales:- Catchments (5 regions: Werribee, Maribyrnong, Yarra, Dandenong, Westernport) and Sub-catchments (69 polygons). This dataset is an update to the Regional River Health Strategy (RRHS) Management Units layer created in 2008. Primary purpose of this data is for reporting of targets, performance objectives, conditions, values etc. relating to the Healthy Waterways Strategy.</div><div><br /></div><div>The sub-catchments in this dataset are an update of the &quot;management units&quot; developed for the Regional River Health Strategy in 2008. This dataset was created by merging sub-catchments from the University of Melbourne sub-catchments layer, commonly referred to as the DCI layer (where DCI refers to Directly Connected Imperviousness). The catchment polygons in this layer are similar to, but not exactly the same as those in the DCI layer currently used internally at Melbourne Water - The internally used layer has 15,901 polygon catchments, whilst the layer used to create this dataset has 16,346 polygon catchments.

			"description": "<div>This layer describes the stormwater priority areas for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Stormwater priority areas were determined by a combination of decision support tools and the co-design process. The decision support tool used was Zonation, which prioritised management actions across the region with the objective of improving instream habitat suitability for platypus, fish and macroinvertebrates. The stormwater priority area polygons were created by merging sub-catchments from University of Melbourne’s subc layer, i.e. the network of sub-catchments used for assessing attenuated imperviousness and for habitat suitability modelling. </div><div><br /></div><div>Primary purpose for this data is identifying stormwater priority areas of Melbourne Water's Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This dataset covers the Greater Melbourne region with the stormwater priority areas presented in this dataset aligning with the priorities of the Melbourne Water Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. However, it is important to note that stormwater management activities require additional judgement to consider whether areas beyond (e.g. upstream) of the priority areas identified will also require treatment to achieve the desired waterway health outcomes.</div><div><br /></div><div>The harvesting and infiltration targets presented in this dataset provide an estimate of what is required to achieve stormwater disconnection and recreation of the natural hydrology. However, is should be noted that these values are approximate only and do not replace site-specific investigations. The values have been calculated in reference to Walsh et al. 2012 , who presented target ranges for infiltration and harvesting required to achieve urban stormwater disconnection (i.e. re-creation of forested/vegetated hydrology). The values presented are the average of the ranges estimated by Walsh et al. 2012. These values do not replace a detailed site investigation. Site-specific factors (soil type, topography, geology and other hydrological features of the catchment) will influence the appropriate targets for a site.</div><div><br /></div><div>For further reading on the prioritisation process see:</div><div><ul><li>Chee et al. (in development), Habitat Suitability Models, Scenarios and Quantitative Action Prioritisation (using Zonation) for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy: A Resource Document, University of Melbourne and Melbourne Water for Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership</li><li>Melbourne Water (in development), Healthy Waterways Strategy Resource Document. Each priority area contains targets for harvesting and infiltration. Achievement of these targets is required to achieve stormwater disconnection. These targets are presented in two ways: per impervious hectare, and total volume to full urban development (i.e. complete urban development to the urban growth boundary). It should be noted that these targets are approximate values only and do not replace site-specific studies. See notes above about how target values were selected.</li></ul></div><div>For further reading, see: Walsh, C. J., Fletcher, T. D., &amp; Burns, M. J. (2012).
